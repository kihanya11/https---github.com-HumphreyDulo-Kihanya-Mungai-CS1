   ```ini
   extension=curl

   ```

3. Set Your Stripe API Keys: In the Stripe.php configuration file, replace `'your_publishable_key'` and `'your_secret_key'` with your actual Stripe API keys:

   ```php
   \Stripe\Stripe::setApiKey('your_secret_key');
   ```

   You can find your API keys in your Stripe account dashboard.
